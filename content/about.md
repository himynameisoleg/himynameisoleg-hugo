I'm a software engineer from Chicago.

Currently I'm a senior engineer at [🧬 Abbott Laboratories](https://abbott.com), where I work in data privacy, consent management and integrations.

Previously, I managed shopping orchestration micro-services at [✈️ United Airlines](https://united.com), and developed marketing and communications applications, chatbots and web applications at [💻 Accenture](https://accenture.com).

I graduated with a BS in Biology from 🎓 Loyola University Chicago and an MS in CS from 🎓 Northeastern Illinois University where I did some [research into recommendation engines](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3603287.3656163).

In my free time I love to 👨‍🍳 cook, 🏃 run, and shoot photos 📷.

## Side Projects
