Previousely, I managed shopping orchestration microservices at [✈️ United Airlines](https://united.com), and developed marketting and communications applications, chatbots and web applications at [💻 Accenture](https://accenture.com).

I graduated with a BS in Biology from 🎓 Loyola University Chicago and an MS in CS from 🎓 Northeastern Illinois Univeristy where I did some [research into recommendation engines](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3603287.3656163). 

In my free time I love to 👨‍🍳 cook, 🏃 run, and dive into projects like home automation, networking, 3D printing, Raspberry Pis IOT, and repairing vintage TVs.
